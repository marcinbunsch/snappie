# Snappie

Snappie is a screenshot upload tool. It uploads screenshots taken in OS X to s3 or ftp server of your choice.

To make it run, create a `.snappie.yml` file in your $HOME dir. This is how it works:

```yml
use: 's3' or 'ftp'
ftp:
  host: YOUR_HOST
  user: USERNAME
  pass: PASSWORD
  dir: DIRECTORY where the screenshots should be placed
  http: PREFIX which will be added before the filename before the link is copied to clipboard
s3:
  access_key_id: ACCESS_KEY_ID
  secret_access_key: SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  bucket: BUCKET_NAME
  http: PREFIX which will be added before the filename before the link is copied to clipboard
```
